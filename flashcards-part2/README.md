## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Challenges including implementing the flashcard flipping functionality as I was unfamiliar with the CSS necessary for the effect. Additionally, using an array of dictionaries and utilizing useState to show specific information proved to be a challenge. Lastly, randomizing the cards and implementing access to previous cards was also challenging.
